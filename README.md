YLTCPBroadcaster is a small library written in Objective-C to find every host with a given TCP port number opened on the network. It works like an UDP broadcast but for the TCP protocol.

*Note: any contribution is welcome.*

## How it works

The main concept behind the `YLTCPBroadcaster` is very simple. To simulate the broadcast, the library creates a  connection to every host on the network on the specified TCP port number. Then it waits for a response and in this manner it can determine whether the host is open on the given port number.

## Usage

Here is the simplest way to use `YLTCPBroadcaster`:

```objective-c
YLTCPBroadcaster *bc = [YLTCPBroadcaster defaultBroadcaster];

[bc scanWithPort:8080 timeoutInterval:1.5 completionHandler:^(NSArray *hosts) {
   // E.g.: ["192.168.0.3", "192.168.0.56", "192.168.0.87"]
   NSLog(@"Available hosts: %@", hosts);
}];
```

However if you want to be more responsive, by displaying the host found in real time in a tableview for example, you can respond to the delegate methods like that:

```objective-c
YLTCPBroadcaster *bc = [YLTCPBroadcaster defaultBroadcaster];
bc.delegate          = self;

[bc scanWithPort:8080 completionHandler:nil];

-(void)tcpBroadcaster:(YLTCPBroadcaster *)broadcaster didFoundHost:(NSString *)host {
  [self.tableView beginUpdates];

  NSIndexPath *indexPath = [NSIndexPath indexPathForRow:_remoteHosts.count inSection:0];
  _remoteHosts           = [_remoteHosts arrayByAddingObject:host];

  [self.tableView insertRowsAtIndexPaths:@[indexPath] withRowAnimation:UITableViewRowAnimationRight];

  [self.tableView endUpdates];
}
```

For more information, please take a look at the example project.

## Requirements

- iOS 6.0+
- Xcode 6.0

## Installation

The recommended approach to use _YLTCPBroadcaster_ in your project is using the [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) package manager, as it provides flexible dependency management and dead simple installation.

### CocoaPods

Install CocoaPods if not already available:

``` bash
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
$ pod setup
```

Go to the directory of your Xcode project, and Create and Edit your Podfile and add YLTCPBroadcaster:

``` bash
$ cd /path/to/MyProject
$ touch Podfile
$ edit Podfile
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'
pod 'YLTCPBroadcaster', '~> 2.0.1'
```

Install into your project:

``` bash
$ pod install
```

Open your project in Xcode from the .xcworkspace file (not the usual project file)

``` bash
$ open MyProject.xcworkspace
```

### Manually

[Download](https://github.com/YannickL/YLTCPBroadcaster/archive/master.zip) the project and copy the `YLTCPBroadcaster` folder into your project and then simply `#import "YLTCPBroadcaster.h"` in the file(s) you would like to use it in.
